# Math to Quant / Quantum Python

This repository contains mathematically rigorous, well-tested Python
implementations of structures and algorithms commonly used in:

- Quantum computing
- Quantitative research / finance
- Scientific computing and data analysis

The emphasis is on translating **abstract mathematics** into **clean,
reliable, and efficient code**.

## Mathematical Focus

The codebase centers around the following mathematical themes:

- **Linear algebra & spectral theory**
  - Linear operators, eigenvalues, SVD
  - Unitary and Hermitian matrices
  - Numerical stability considerations

- **Quantum computation**
  - Quantum states and measurements
  - Unitary evolution
  - Monte Carlo simulation of measurement outcomes

- **Probability & stochastic processes**
  - Random variables and expectations
  - Markov chains
  - Monte Carlo integration

- **Graphs & topology**
  - Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Union–Find)
  - Simplicial complexes
  - Persistent homology (dimension 0)
